The 2-bit multiplier implemented in this project utilizes the readily available multiplier IP core in Vivado. This design takes two 2-bit binary inputs, A and B, and produces a 4-bit product output, P, synchronized by a clock signal. By instantiating the Vivado multiplier IP, the design benefits from optimized hardware implementation, efficient resource usage, and reliable timing control. The use of a clock ensures that the multiplication operation is performed in sync with the system, making it suitable for integration into larger digital systems or FPGA designs. This approach leverages Vivadoâ€™s robust IP catalog, streamlining development while maintaining flexibility and scalability for future enhancements.
